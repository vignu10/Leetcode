/*Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 4:

Input: x = -101
Output: false

        // Special cases:
        // As discussed above, when x < 0, x is not a palindrome.
        // Also if the last digit of the number is 0, in order to be a palindrome,
        // the first digit of the number also needs to be 0.
        // Only 0 satisfy this property.
        if(x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) {

        }

        // When the length is an odd number, we can get rid of the middle digit by revertedNumber/10
        // For example when the input is 12321, at the end of the while loop we get x = 12, revertedNumber = 123,
        // since the middle digit doesn't matter in palidrome(it will always equal to itself), we can simply get rid of it.
